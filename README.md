# Scheduling Algorithm Visualization

A tool to visualize and test various scheduling algorithms with an interactive Gantt chart, supporting both Python and Dart/Flutter.

## Features

- Easy scheduling algorithm simulation with Python.
- Interactive Gantt chart for result visualization in the browser or emulator.
- Scrollable, draggable chart with touch/mouse support.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Dart/Flutter SDK
- Any required Python or Dart packages (list them here)

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/m-azeem-787/scheduling-algo.git
   cd scheduling-algo
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Dart/Flutter dependencies**
   ```sh
   flutter pub get
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the scheduler**
   ```sh
   python scheduler.py
   ```

2. **Run the main Dart application**
   - Select browser (recommended) or emulator to run:
     ```sh
     flutter run -d chrome    # For browser
     flutter run -d emulator  # For emulator
     ```

## Interacting with the Gantt Chart

- The chart is scrollable.
- Touch and drag, or hold the left mouse button and drag, or use Shift + Mouse Wheel.
